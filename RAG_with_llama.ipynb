These platforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems\\nand services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is\\ncritical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.\\nOn June 7, 2024, we completed a 10-for-1 forward stock split. All share and per share amounts\\npresented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.\\nRevenue\\nRevenue was a record $30.0 billion, up 122% from a year ago and up 15% sequentially.\\nData Center revenue was a record, up 154% from a year ago and up 16% sequentially. The strong\\nsequential and year-on-year growth was driven by demand for our Hopper GPU computing platform\\nfor training and inferencing of large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI\\napplications. Sequential growth was driven by consumer internet and enterprise companies. Cloud\\nservice providers represented roughly 45% of our Data Center revenue, and more than 50% stemmed\\nfrom consumer internet and enterprise companies. Strong year-on-year growth was driven by all\\ncustomer types from both compute and networking revenue. Customers continue to accelerate their\\nHopper architecture purchases while gearing up to adopt Blackwell. Data Center compute revenue\\nwas $22.6 billion, up 162% from a year ago and up 17% sequentially. Networking revenue was $3.7\\nbillion, up 114% from a year ago driven by InfiniBand and Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes\\nSpectrum-X end-to-end ethernet platform. Networking revenue sequentially was up 16% and\\nincludes a doubling of Ethernet for AI revenue.\\nWe shipped customer samples of our Blackwell architecture in the second quarter. We executed a\\nchange to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield. Blackwell production ramp is\\nscheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026. In the fourth quarter, we\\nexpect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue. Hopper demand is strong, and shipments\\nare expected to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025.\\nGaming revenue was up 16% from a year ago and up 9% sequentially. These increases reflect higher\\nsales of our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs and game console SOCs. We had solid demand in the\\nsecond quarter for our gaming GPUs as part of the back-to-school season.\\nProfessional Visualization revenue was up 20% from a year ago and up 6% sequentially. These\\nincreases were driven by the continued ramp of RTX GPU workstations based on our Ada\\narchitecture.\\nAutomotive revenue was up 37% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. These increases were\\ndriven by AI Cockpit solutions and self-driving platforms.\\nGross Margin\\nGAAP and non-GAAP gross margins increased from a year ago on strong Data Center revenue growth\\nprimarily driven by our Hopper GPU computing platform. Sequentially, gross margins decreased\\nprimarily driven by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material and a higher mix of new\\nproducts within Data Center.\\nExpenses\\nGAAP operating expenses were up 48% from a year ago and up 12% sequentially, and non-GAAP\\noperating expenses were up 52% from a year ago and up 12% sequentially. These increases were\\nlargely driven by compensation and benefits, reflecting growth in employees and compensation.',\n",

Non-GAAP OI&E primarily\\nexcludes the gains or losses from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities.\\nInterest income was $444 million, up from a year ago and sequentially, primarily reflecting higher\\ncash balances. Net realized and unrealized gains from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held\\nequity securities were $193 million, reflecting fair value adjustments.\\nGAAP effective tax rate was 13.6%, an increase from a year ago reflecting the lower effect of tax\\nbenefits from the foreign derived intangible income deduction relative to the increase in pre-tax\\nincome. Non-GAAP effective tax rate was 16.6%.\\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $34.8 billion, up from $16.0 billion a year ago\\nand $31.4 billion a quarter ago. The increases primarily reflect higher revenue partially offset by\\nhigher cash taxes, stock repurchases and repayment of $1.25 billion of our notes at maturity.\\nAccounts receivable was $14.1 billion with 43 days sales outstanding (DSO). Accounts receivable\\nreflects $2.8 billion of customer payments received prior to next quarter’s invoice due date.\\nInventory was $6.7 billion with 81 days sales of inventory (DSI). Purchase commitments and\\nobligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity were $27.8 billion, including new commitments\\nfor Blackwell capacity and components.

In order\\nfor NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods,\\nthe company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These\\nreconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation\\nexpense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains from non-affiliated investments and\\npublicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the\\nassociated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash\\nprovided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and\\nintangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA\\nbelieves the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall\\nunderstanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s\\nnon-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the\\ncompany’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP\\nmeasures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\\nCertain statements in this CFO Commentary including, but not limited to, statements as to: our computing platforms\\nproviding tremendous acceleration for applications and delivering unique value; markets where our expertise is critical;\\ncustomers continuing to accelerate their Hopper architecture purchases while gearing up to adopt Blackwell; the Blackwell\\nGPU mask change improving production yield; Blackwell production ramp and revenue timing; expected Blackwell revenue;\\nHopper demand being strong and expected increase in shipments in the second half of fiscal 2025; cloud service\\nagreements being used to support our research and development efforts and our DGX Cloud offerings; our expected full-\\nyear gross margins and operating expenses; and our financial outlook and expected tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal\\n2025 are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to be materially\\ndifferent than expectations.

BUSINESS\\nOverview\\nWe design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer\\nservices related to our products. We generally sell our products directly to customers, and continue to grow our customer-facing infrastructure through a\\nglobal network of vehicle showrooms and service centers, Mobile Service, body shops, Supercharger stations and Destination Chargers to accelerate the\\nwidespread adoption of our products. We emphasize performance, attractive styling and the safety of our users and workforce in the design and\\nmanufacture of our products and are continuing to develop full self-driving technology for improved safety. We also strive to lower the cost of ownership\\nfor our customers through continuous efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and by offering financial and other services tailored to our products.\\nOur mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We believe that this mission, along with our engineering expertise,\\nvertically integrated business model and focus on user experience differentiate us from other companies.\\nSegment Information\\nWe operate as two reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\\nThe automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of high-performance fully electric vehicles as well as\\nsales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment also includes services and other, which includes sales of used vehicles, non-\\nwarranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts, paid Supercharging, vehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise. The energy generation\\nand storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related\\nservices and sales of solar energy systems incentives.\\nOur Products and Services\\nAutomotive\\nWe currently manufacture five different consumer vehicles – the Model 3, Y, S, X and Cybertruck. Model 3 is a four-door mid-size sedan that we\\ndesigned for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal. Model Y is a compact sport utility vehicle (“SUV”) built on the Model 3 platform\\nwith seating for up to seven adults. Model S is a four-door full-size sedan and Model X is a mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven adults. Model S and\\nModel X feature the highest performance characteristics and longest ranges that we offer in a sedan and SUV, respectively. In November 2023, we\\nentered the consumer pickup truck market with first deliveries of the Cybertruck, a full-size electric pickup truck with a stainless steel exterior that has\\nthe utility and strength of a truck while featuring the speed of a sports car.\\nIn 2022, we also began early production and deliveries of a commercial electric vehicle, the Tesla Semi. We have planned electric vehicles to\\naddress additional vehicle markets, and to continue leveraging developments in our proprietary Full Self-Driving (“FSD”) Capability features, battery cell\\nand other technologies.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nEnergy Storage Products\\nPowerwall and Megapack are our lithium-ion battery energy storage products. Powerwall, which we sell directly to customers, as well as through\\nchannel partners, is designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility. Megapack is an energy storage solution for commercial, industrial,\\nutility and energy generation customers, multiple of which may be grouped together to form larger installations of gigawatt hours (“GWh”) or greater\\ncapacity.\\nWe also continue to develop software capabilities for remotely controlling and dispatching our energy storage systems across a wide range of\\nmarkets and applications, including through our real-time energy control and optimization platforms.\\n4',\n",
              " 'Table of Contents\\nSolar Energy Offerings\\nWe sell retrofit solar energy systems to customers and channel partners and also make them available through power purchase agreement (“PPA”)\\narrangements. We purchase most of the components for our retrofit solar energy systems from multiple sources to ensure competitive pricing and\\nadequate supply. We also design and manufacture certain components for our solar energy products.\\nWe sell our Solar Roof, which combines premium glass roof tiles with energy generation, directly to customers, as well as through channel\\ncustomers. We continue to improve our installation capability and efficiency, including through collaboration with real estate developers and builders on\\nnew homes.\\nTechnology\\nAutomotive\\nBattery and Powertrain\\nOur core vehicle technology competencies include powertrain engineering and manufacturing and our ability to design vehicles that utilize the\\nunique advantages of an electric powertrain. We have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be adaptable, efficient, reliable and cost-effective\\nwhile withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment. We offer dual motor powertrain vehicles, which use two electric motors to maximize traction\\nand performance in an all-wheel drive configuration, as well as vehicle powertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further increased\\nperformance in certain versions of Model S and Model X, Cybertruck and the Tesla Semi.\\nWe maintain extensive testing and R&D capabilities for battery cells, packs and systems, and have built an expansive body of knowledge on lithium-\\nion cell chemistry types and performance characteristics. In order to enable a greater supply of cells for our products with higher energy density at lower\\ncosts, we have developed a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improved manufacturing processes.\\nVehicle Control and Infotainment Software\\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs utilize sophisticated control software. Control systems in our vehicles\\noptimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging and control all infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software,\\nincluding most of the user interfaces, internally and update our vehicles’ software regularly through over-the-air updates.\\nSelf-Driving Development and Artificial Intelligence\\nWe have expertise in developing technologies, systems and software to enable self-driving vehicles using primarily vision-based technologies. Our\\nFSD Computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles, and we are also developing additional computer hardware to better enable the massive amounts\\nof field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural networks for real-world performance.\\nCurrently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD Capability options. Although at present the\\ndriver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle, our systems provide safety and convenience functionality that relieves drivers of the most\\ntedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel much like the system that airplane pilots use, when conditions permit. As with other vehicle\\nsystems, we improve these functions in our vehicles over time through over-the-air updates.\\nWe intend to establish in the future an autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network, which we expect would also allow us to access a new customer base\\neven as modes of transportation evolve.\\nWe are also applying our artificial intelligence learnings from self-driving technology to the field of robotics, such as through Optimus, a robotic\\nhumanoid in development, which is controlled by the same AI system.\\n5',\n",
              " 'Table of Contents\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nEnergy Storage Products\\nWe leverage many of the component-level technologies from our vehicles in our energy storage products. By taking a modular approach to the\\ndesign of battery systems, we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products. Additionally, our expertise in power electronics\\nenables our battery systems to interconnect with electricity grids while providing fast-acting systems for power injection and absorption. We have also\\ndeveloped software to remotely control and dispatch our energy storage systems.\\nSolar Energy Systems\\nWe have engineered Solar Roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation. The efficiency of our\\nsolar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which incorporates our power electronics technologies. We designed both products to integrate\\nwith Powerwall.\\nDesign and Engineering\\nAutomotive\\nWe have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems. Our\\nteam has significant experience in computer-aided design as well as durability, strength and crash test simulations, which reduces the product\\ndevelopment time of new models. We have also achieved complex engineering feats in stamping, casting and thermal systems, and developed a method\\nto integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without separate battery packs to optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost\\ncharacteristics.\\nWe are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while taking action to localize our vehicle designs and production for particular\\nmarkets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As we increase our capabilities, particularly in the\\nareas of automation, die-making and line-building, we are also making strides in the simulations modeling these capabilities prior to construction.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nOur expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design, engineer, manufacture and install energy generating and\\nstorage products and components, including at the residential through utility scale. For example, the modular design of our Megapack utility-scale battery\\nline is intended to significantly reduce the amount of assembly required in the field. We also customize solutions including our energy storage products,\\nsolar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet their specific needs.\\nSales and Marketing\\nHistorically, we have been able to achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. We continue to monitor our\\npublic narrative and brand, and tailor our marketing efforts accordingly, including through investments in customer education and advertising as\\nnecessary.\\nAutomotive\\nDirect Sales\\nOur vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some jurisdictions, we also have\\ngalleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not transact in the sale of vehicles. We believe this infrastructure\\nenables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, educate consumers about electric vehicles, make our vehicles more\\naffordable, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback.\\nWe reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our sales channels. However, sales\\nof vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to volatility from time to time.\\n6',\n",
              " 'Table of Contents\\nUsed Vehicle Sales\\nOur used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the trade-in of a customer’s existing Tesla or non-Tesla vehicle with the sale of\\na new or used Tesla vehicle. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third\\nparties. We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources including lease returns.\\nPublic Charging\\nWe have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial-grade, high-speed vehicle chargers. Where possible, we co-\\nlocate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power. Supercharger stations are typically\\nplaced along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle owners the ability to enjoy quick, reliable charging along an\\nextensive network with convenient stops. Use of the Supercharger network either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs. In\\nNovember 2021, we began to offer Supercharger access to non-Tesla vehicles in certain locations in support of our mission to accelerate the world’s\\ntransition to sustainable energy, and in November 2022, we opened up our previously proprietary charging connector as the North American Charging\\nStandard (NACS). This enables all electric vehicles and charging stations to interoperate — which makes charging easier and more efficient for everyone\\nand advances our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. Following this, a number of major automotive companies announced\\ntheir adoption of NACS, with their access to the Supercharger network beginning in phases in 2024 and their production of NACS vehicles beginning no\\nlater than 2025. We also engaged SAE International to govern NACS as an industry standard, now named J3400. We continue to monitor and increase our\\nnetwork of Tesla Superchargers in anticipation of future demand.\\nWe also work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting employees, to offer additional\\ncharging options for our customers, as well as single-family homeowners and multi-family residential entities, to deploy home charging solutions.\\nIn-App Upgrades\\nAs our vehicles are capable of being updated remotely over-the-air, our customers may purchase additional paid options and features through the\\nTesla app or through the in-vehicle user interface. We expect that this functionality will also allow us to offer certain options and features on a\\nsubscription basis in the future.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nWe market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential, commercial and industrial customers and utilities through a variety of\\nchannels, including through our website, stores and galleries, as well as through our network of channel partners, and in the case of some commercial\\ncustomers, through PPA transactions. We emphasize simplicity, standardization and accessibility to make it easy and cost-effective for customers to adopt\\nclean energy, while reducing our customer acquisition costs.\\nService and Warranty\\nAutomotive\\nService\\nWe provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service locations and through Tesla Mobile Service technicians who perform work\\nremotely at customers’ homes or other locations.

Our solar PPAs, offered primarily to commercial customers, charge a fee per kilowatt-hour based on the amount of\\nelectricity produced by our solar energy systems.\\nManufacturing\\nWe currently have manufacturing facilities in the U.S. in Northern California, in Buffalo, New York, Gigafactory New York; in Austin, Texas,\\nGigafactory Texas and near Reno, Nevada, Gigafactory Nevada. At these facilities, we manufacture and assemble, among other things, vehicles, certain\\nvehicle parts and components, such as our battery packs and battery cells, energy storage components and solar products and components.\\nInternationally, we also have manufacturing facilities in China (Gigafactory Shanghai) and Germany (Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg), which allows\\nus to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating the\\nimpact of unfavorable tariffs. In March 2023, we announced the location of our next Gigafactory in Monterrey, Mexico. Generally, we continue to expand\\nproduction capacity at our existing facilities. We also intend to further increase cost-competitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding\\nlocal manufacturing.\\nSupply Chain\\nOur products use thousands of parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world. We have developed close relationships with\\nvendors of key parts such as battery cells, electronics and complex vehicle assemblies. Certain components purchased from these suppliers are shared or\\nare similar across many product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale.\\n8',\n",
              " 'Table of Contents\\nAs is the case for some automotive companies, some of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers. Where multiple\\nsources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize\\npotential production risks due to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks\\nfor components with lengthy procurement lead times.\\nOur products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. Pricing for these materials is governed by\\nmarket conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as supply and demand and market speculation. We strive to\\nexecute long-term supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when feasible, and we currently believe that we have adequate access to\\nraw materials supplies to meet the needs of our operations.\\nGovernmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations\\nGlobally, the ownership of our products by our customers is impacted by various government credits, incentives, and policies. Our business and\\nproducts are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions.\\nThe operation of our business is also impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements.

The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and\\nenergy storage manufacture or purchase, including through providing tax credits to consumers. For example, qualifying Tesla customers may receive up\\nto $7,500 in federal tax credits for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles in the U.S. through 2032.\\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles (“ZEVs”), greenhouse gas, fuel\\neconomy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory\\nrequirements. Sales of these credits are recognized within automotive regulatory credits revenue in our consolidated statements of operations included\\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nEnergy Storage System Incentives and Policies\\nWhile the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms\\nat the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage.\\nFor example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S. federal tax credits\\ndescribed below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale\\nenergy markets. In addition, California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage, and behind-the-meter energy\\nstorage systems qualify for funding under the California Self Generation Incentive Program. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these\\nprograms. In certain instances our customers may transfer such credits to us as contract consideration. In such transactions, they are included as a\\ncomponent of energy generation and storage revenues in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form\\n10-K.',\n",

Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness and\\noccupant protection requirements. Our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable\\nFMVSS with limited or no exemptions, however, FMVSS are subject to change from time to time. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles\\nmeet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S.\\nWe are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, Theft\\nPrevention Act requirements, labeling requirements and other information provided to customers in writing, Early Warning Reporting requirements\\nregarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, a Standing General Order requiring reports regarding crashes\\ninvolving vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems, and additional requirements for cooperating with compliance and safety\\ninvestigations and recall reporting. The U.S. Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain\\ninformation regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel\\neconomy ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and New Car\\nAssessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available.\\nOur vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those\\nregulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Some of those regulations impact or prevent the\\nrollout of new vehicle features.\\nSelf-Driving Vehicles\\nGenerally, laws pertaining to self-driving vehicles are evolving globally, and in some cases may create restrictions on features or vehicle designs\\nthat we develop. While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations pertaining specifically to self-driving vehicles or self-driving equipment, NHTSA has\\npublished recommended guidelines on self-driving vehicles, apart from the FMVSS and manufacturer reporting obligations, and retains the authority to\\ninvestigate and/or take action on the safety or compliance of any vehicle, equipment or features operating on public roads. Certain U.S. states also have\\nlegal restrictions on the operation, registration or licensure of self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them.

Certain states have asserted that the laws in such states do not permit automobile\\nmanufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or that they otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or perform\\nwarranty repairs on vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the sale out of the state.\\nIn certain such states, we have opened “galleries” that serve an educational purpose and where sales may not occur.\\nSome automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative\\nprocesses to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations. Certain dealer associations have also actively\\nlobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to our ownership and operation of our\\nown retail and service locations. We expect such challenges to continue, and we intend to actively fight any such efforts.\\nBattery Safety and Testing\\nOur battery packs are subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined to include lithium-\\nion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation.

To operate our\\nsystems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities. Sales of electricity and non-sale equipment leases by third parties,\\nsuch as our leases and PPAs, have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions.\\nSolar Energy—Net Metering\\nMost states in the U.S. make net energy metering, or net metering, available to solar customers. Net metering typically allows solar customers to\\ninterconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated\\nby their solar energy system that is exported to the grid. In certain jurisdictions, regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available\\nunder net metering or have proposed to do so.\\nCompetition\\nAutomotive\\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as a significant and\\ngrowing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter the\\nelectric vehicle market.\\nWe believe that our vehicles compete in the market based on both their traditional segment classification as well as their propulsion technology.

              " 'Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2024 Outlook\\nAutomotive—Production\\nThe following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the\\ndate of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\\nProduction Location Vehicle Model(s) Production Status\\nFremont Factory Model S / Model X Active\\nModel 3 / Model Y Active\\nGigafactory Shanghai Model 3 / Model Y Active\\nGigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg Model Y Active\\nGigafactory Texas Model Y Active\\nCybertruck Active\\nGigafactory Nevada Tesla Semi Pilot production\\nVarious Next Generation Platform In development\\nTBD Tesla Roadster In development\\nWe are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes capacity for manufacturing new vehicle models such as our Cybertruck and\\nnext generation platform, and ramping all of our production vehicles to their installed production capacities as well as increasing production rate and\\nefficiency at our current factories. The next phase of production growth will depend on the continued ramp at our factories and the introduction of our\\nnext generation platform, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are\\ndeveloping to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease\\nproduction costs and increase affordability and customer awareness.\\nThese plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new product\\nand manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages\\nand any future impact from events outside of our control. For example, during the third quarter of 2023, we experienced a sequential decline in\\nproduction volumes due to pre-planned shutdowns for upgrades at various factories. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our\\nplans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory.\\nAutomotive—Demand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure\\nOur cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability\\nand have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles’\\nperformance and functionality, including through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot, FSD Capability, and other software features\\nand delivering new vehicles, such as our Cybertruck. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and\\nincreasing environmental regulations and initiatives.\\nHowever, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the\\nenvironment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, interest rate fluctuations and the liquidity of enterprise\\ncustomers. For example, inflationary pressures have increased across the markets in which we operate. In an effort to curb this trend, central banks in\\ndeveloped countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, impacting the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of\\nvehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our\\noperations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to\\nadjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. Additionally, our suppliers’ liquidity and allocation plans may be affected by current',\n",
              " 'adjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. Additionally, our suppliers’ liquidity and allocation plans may be affected by current\\nchallenges in the North American automotive industry, which could reduce our access to components or result in unfavorable changes to cost. These\\nmacroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and in turn our\\noperating margin. Changes in government and economic incentives in relation to electric vehicles may also impact our sales. We will continue to adjust\\naccordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction, including improved production innovation and efficiency at our newest\\nfactories and lower logistics costs, and focus on operating leverage will continue to benefit us in relation to our competitors, while our new products will\\nhelp enable future growth.\\n34',\n",
              " 'As our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our\\ntotal deliveries. We are also committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month of each quarter, which will help to reduce the\\ncost per vehicle. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and\\ncharging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer\\nsatisfaction. In particular, as other automotive manufacturers have announced their adoption of the North American Charging Standard (“NACS”) and\\nagreements with us to utilize our Superchargers, we must correspondingly expand our network in order to ensure adequate availability to meet customer\\ndemands. We also remain focused on continued enhancements of the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\\nThe long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of\\nour energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including the construction of a new Megafactory in Shanghai and the ongoing ramp at our\\nMegafactory in Lathrop, California. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of\\nspecific project milestones. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering\\nexperience. In addition, we continue to seek to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof. As these product lines grow, we\\nwill have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and ensure the availability of qualified personnel, particularly skilled\\nelectricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof.\\nCash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends\\nOur capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time,\\nand may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously ramping new products, building or ramping\\nmanufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, expanding our Supercharger\\nnetwork and investing in autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled training and products, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending\\non overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital\\nefficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all\\nother continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to exceed $10.00 billion in 2024 and be\\nbetween $8.00 to $10.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years.\\nOur business has been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital\\nmanagement resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also generally facilitating positive cash\\ngeneration. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and\\nprovide financing options to our customers. At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods\\ndepending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain',\n",

Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as\\nlong as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The\\npreparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\\nrevenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions\\nthat we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.\\nAccordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an\\nongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation,\\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.\\n35',\n",
              " 'The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return\\nreserves, the collectability of accounts and financing receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of\\nfinancial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have\\nassessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially\\naffected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new\\nevents occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nAutomotive Sales\\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that\\nmeet the definition of a performance obligation under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC\\n606”), including access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-\\nair software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers.\\nPayments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for\\nwhich payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration\\nfor expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our\\ninternet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized\\nover time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging\\nincentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services\\nover the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD Capability features is recognized when\\nfunctionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we\\nestimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information\\nthat may be available.\\nInventory Valuation\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which\\napproximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about\\ncurrent and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory.\\nThis requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product.\\nOnce inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result\\nin the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.',\n",

A small\\nchange in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\\n36',\n",
              " 'Warranties\\nWe provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation\\nand storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our\\nbest estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims\\nincurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our\\nhistorical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include\\nprojected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs,\\nas the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12\\nmonths is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated\\nbalance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated\\namounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-\\ncurrent assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nDue to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and for our employee\\nstock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock\\noption awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are\\nsubjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our\\ncommon stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards,\\nusually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is\\nrecognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual\\nperformance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may\\ncalculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based\\ncompensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and\\ndevelopment expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions.

We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In\\ncompleting our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted\\nfor permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in\\nrecent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company’s projected\\nfuture results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our\\ncommon stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in\\nbusiness that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income.

In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and\\ncalculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes\\npayable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are\\nsupportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are\\nrequired to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in\\neffect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to\\nour tax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past\\nexperience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax\\naudit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate.

              " 'Tesla, Inc.\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nNote 1 – Overview\\nTesla, Inc. (“Tesla”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop,\\nmanufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our\\nproducts. Our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), organizes our company, manages resource allocations and\\nmeasures performance among two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and reflect our accounts and operations and\\nthose of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”), we\\nconsolidate any variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We have formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary\\ncourse of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our\\ndirect vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity;\\nhowever, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC\\n810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the\\nVIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits\\nfrom the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not\\nconsidered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 16, Variable Interest Entity\\nArrangements). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All\\nintercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. The estimates used for, but not limited to,\\ndetermining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, income taxes, the collectability of accounts\\nand finance receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual\\nvalue of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any\\nspecific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or\\nliabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is\\nobtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\\nReclassifications\\nCertain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the\\naccompanying notes.\\n54',\n",

We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer,\\nwhich is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms\\ncustomary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return\\nreserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback\\nterms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are\\nprovisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such\\nservices to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We\\nrecognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle.\\nRevenue related to FSD Capability features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized\\nover time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the\\nservice, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\\nAny fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales\\nrevenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to\\nautomotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to\\nshipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over\\nvehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes\\ncollected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\\n55',\n",

Under these programs,\\nwe originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partner, with the\\ntransaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606. We receive upfront payment for the vehicle, do not bear casualty and credit risks during the\\nlease term, and we provide a guarantee capped to a limit if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle’s contract residual value at the end\\nof the lease term. We estimate a guarantee liability in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees and record it within other liabilities on our consolidated\\nbalance sheet. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market value of vehicles sold under this program to determine whether there have been\\nchanges to the amount of expected resale value guarantee payments. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as\\nmarket conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. The total guarantee liability on vehicles sold under this program was\\nimmaterial as of December 31, 2023.\\nDeferred revenue related to the access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging\\nprograms and over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales consisted of the following (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023 2022\\nDeferred revenue— beginning of period $ 2,913 $ 2,382\\nAdditions 1,201 1,178\\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing contracts 17 (67)\\nRevenue recognized (595) (580)\\nDeferred revenue— end of period $ 3,536 $ 2,913\\nDeferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as\\nof the balance sheet date.

We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements.\\nPayments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment\\nterms customary to the business.

Qualifying\\ncustomers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers are generally required to\\nreturn the vehicles to us. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a\\nstraight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $1.86 billion, $1.75 billion and $1.25 billion of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of\\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, we had deferred $458 million and $407 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized\\non a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.\\nOur policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\\nDirect Sales-Type Leasing Program\\nWe have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842, Leases\\n(“ASC 842”), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Depending on the specific program, customers may or may not have a right to return the vehicle to\\nus during or at the end of the lease term. If the customer does not have a right to return, the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease\\nterm after making all contractual payments. Under the programs for which there is a right to return, the purchase option is reasonably certain to be\\nexercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual\\npayments. Our arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-\\ntype lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest\\nincome based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the\\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $215 million, $683 million and $369 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue\\nand $164 million, $427 million and $234 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue.\\nServices and Other Revenue\\nServices and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts, paid Supercharging,\\nvehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise.\\nRevenues related to repair, maintenance and vehicle insurance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service\\nplans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell\\nused vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue\\nallocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, vehicle\\ncomponents, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary\\nto the business.

Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of\\nthe engineering, design and installation of the system. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy\\nsystem upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system\\nand the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale\\ncommercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the\\nproduct has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon\\ninvoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.\\nFor large commercial and utility grade energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system,\\ncustomers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time\\nusing the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales.\\nIn instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the\\ncontract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using\\nmarket data for comparable products. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of energy\\nstorage systems. As our contract costs related to energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are\\nexpensed as incurred.\\nAs part of our energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system\\nwill meet or exceed the minimum energy performance requirements specified in the contract. If an energy storage system does not meet the\\nperformance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large\\ncommercial and utility grade energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market\\nparticipation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract\\ninception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates\\nare included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments, which is\\nrecognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term.

Valuation allowances are established when\\nnecessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\\nWe monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. Significant judgment is\\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net\\ndeferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider\\nour history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual\\nearnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary\\ndifferences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company’s projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating\\nresults relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions\\nimpacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income.\\nOur valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.\\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is\\nmore likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to\\nunrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.\\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries.\\nUnder GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such\\namounts into our measurement of deferred taxes.

We have determined\\nthat the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the methodology for\\ncalculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit-sharing arrangements is a\\nbalance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling\\ninterests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on\\nthe consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV\\nmethod, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the\\namounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets\\nof the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and\\ndistributed to the third parties.

However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least\\nequal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the\\nconsolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets.

The ASU simplifies\\nthe accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470-20, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for\\nconvertible instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives\\nunder Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no\\nlonger required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized\\ncost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when\\napplying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible debt instruments, the\\nmost significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share\\nsettlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies\\nfor a scope exception from derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of contracts that are recognized as assets or\\nliabilities.\\nOn January 1, 2021, we adopted the ASU using the modified retrospective method. We recognized a favorable $211 million cumulative effect of\\ninitially applying the ASU as an adjustment to the January 1, 2021 opening balance of accumulated deficit. Due to the recombination of the equity\\nconversion component of our convertible debt remaining outstanding, additional paid in capital was reduced by $474 million and convertible senior notes\\n(mezzanine equity) was reduced by $51 million. The removal of the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation had the effect of\\nincreasing our net debt balance by $269 million and we reduced property, plant and equipment by $45 million related to previously capitalized interest.\\nThe prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in\\neffect for those periods.\\nNote 3 – Digital Assets, Net\\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we purchased and/or received immaterial amounts of digital assets.

In\\nparticular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into\\nrelated agreements. We have determined that the funds are VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits\\ncriterion under ASC 810. We have considered the provisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to manage and make decisions that affect\\nthe operation of these VIEs, including determining the solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these\\nVIEs, redeploying solar energy systems and managing customer receivables. We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the\\nagreements are more protective in nature rather than participating.\\nAs the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of\\nthese VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Cash\\ndistributions of income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss\\nand tax credits, are allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the agreements.\\nGenerally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor’s interest in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or\\nthe formula specified in the agreements.\\nUpon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements.\\nPursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have been contracted to provide services to the funds, such as\\noperations and maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In some instances, we have guaranteed payments to the\\nfund investors as specified in the agreements. A fund’s creditors have no recourse to our general credit or to that of other funds. Certain assets of the\\nfunds have been pledged as collateral for their obligations.\\n90',\n",

(the “Company”)\\nbelieves that it is appropriate for the Company to adopt this Clawback Policy (this “Policy”) to be applied to the certain\\nexecutive officers of the Company and adopts this Policy to be effective as of the Effective Date.\\n1. Definitions\\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following definitions shall apply:\\na) “Company Group” means the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable.\\nb) “Covered Compensation” means any Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a person who served as an\\nExecutive Officer at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation and that was\\nReceived (i) on or after October 2, 2023 and (ii) after the person became an Executive Officer.\\nc) “Effective Date” means November 15, 2023.\\nd) “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means the amount of Covered Compensation Received by a person during\\nthe fiscal period when the applicable Financial Reporting Measure relating to such Covered Compensation was\\nattained that exceeds the amount of Covered Compensation that otherwise would have been Received by such\\nperson had such amount been determined based on the applicable Restatement, computed without regard to any\\ntaxes paid (i.e., on a pre-tax basis). For Covered Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return,\\nwhere the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly\\nfrom the information in a Restatement, the Committee will determine the amount of such Covered Compensation\\nthat constitutes Erroneously Awarded Compensation, if any, based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the\\nRestatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Covered Compensation was granted,\\nvested or paid and the Committee shall maintain documentation of such determination and provide such\\ndocumentation to Nasdaq.\\ne) “Exchange Act” means the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\\nf) “Executive Officer” means each “executive officer” of the Company (as defined in Rule 10D-1(d) under the\\nExchange Act), which shall be deemed to include any individuals identified by the Company as executive officers\\npursuant to Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act.

Financial Reporting Measures may or may not be filed with the SEC and may be\\npresented outside the Company’s financial statements, such as in Managements’ Discussion and Analysis of\\nFinancial Conditions and Result of Operations or in the performance graph required under Item 201(e) of\\nRegulation S-K under the Exchange Act.\\nh) “Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in\\npart upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.\\ni) “Lookback Period” means the three completed fiscal years (plus any transition period of less than nine months\\nthat is within or immediately following the three completed fiscal years and that results from a change in the\\nCompany’s fiscal year) immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare a\\nRestatement for a given reporting period, with such date being the earlier of: (i) the date the Board, a committee\\nof the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not\\nrequired, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare a\\nRestatement, or (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a\\nRestatement. Recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation under the Policy is not dependent on if or\\nwhen the Restatement is actually filed.\\nj) “Nasdaq” means the Nasdaq Stock Market.\\nk) “Received”: Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed “Received” in the Company’s fiscal period during which\\nthe Financial Reporting Measure specified in or otherwise relating to the Incentive-Based Compensation award is\\nattained, even if the grant, certification of achievement, vesting or payment of the Incentive-Based Compensation\\noccurs after the end of that period.\\nl) “Restatement” means an accounting restatement required due to the material noncompliance by the Company\\nwith any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including (i) to correct an error in previously\\nissued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (commonly referred to\\nas a “Big R” restatement) or (ii) to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is not material\\nto the previously issued financial statements but that would result in a material misstatement if the error were\\ncorrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (commonly referred to as a “little r”\\nrestatement). Changes to the Company’s financial statements that do not represent error corrections under the\\nthen-current relevant accounting standards will not constitute Restatements.\\n2',\n",
              " 'm) “SEC” means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\\nn) “Subsidiary” means any domestic or foreign corporation, partnership, association, joint stock company, joint\\nventure, trust or unincorporated organization “affiliated” with the Company, that is, directly or indirectly, through\\none or more intermediaries, “controlling”, “controlled by” or “under common control with”, the Company.\\n“Control” for this purpose means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of\\nthe management and policies of such person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, contract or\\notherwise.\\n2.

Means of Repayment\\nIn the event that the Committee determines that any person shall repay any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, the\\nCommittee shall provide written notice to such person by email or certified mail to the physical address on file with the\\nCompany Group for such person, and the person shall satisfy such repayment in a manner and on such terms as required\\nby the Committee, and the Company Group shall be entitled to set off the repayment amount against any amount owed to\\nthe person by the Company Group, to require the forfeiture of any award granted by the Company Group to the person, or\\nto take any and all necessary actions to reasonably promptly recoup the repayment amount from the person, in each case,\\nto the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, including without limitation, Section 409A of the U.S.\\n3',\n",

The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which\\nprioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level\\nII) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is\\nlittle or no market data.

The next phase of production growth will depend on the\\ncontinued ramp at our factories and be initiated by advances in autonomy and the introduction of new products, including those built on our next\\ngeneration vehicle platform, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are\\ndeveloping to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease\\nproduction costs and increase affordability and customer awareness.\\nThese plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new product\\nand manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages\\nand any future impact from events outside of our control. For example, during the first quarter of 2024, we experienced a sequential decline in production\\nvolumes partially caused by the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory, and factory shutdowns at Gigafactory\\nBerlin-Brandenburg resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack.

We will also continue to generate demand by improving our vehicles’ performance and\\nfunctionality, including through product offerings and features based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot, FSD (Supervised), and other software, and\\ndelivering new vehicles and vehicle options. In addition, we have been increasing awareness, and expanding our vehicle financing programs, including\\nattractive leasing terms for our customers. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and\\nincreasing environmental regulations and initiatives.\\nHowever, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the\\nenvironment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, interest rate fluctuations and the liquidity of enterprise\\ncustomers. For example, inflationary pressures have increased across the markets in which we operate. In an effort to curb this trend, central banks in\\ndeveloped countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, impacting the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of\\nvehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our\\noperations.

These platforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems\\nand services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is\\ncritical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.\\nOn June 7, 2024, we completed a 10-for-1 forward stock split. All share and per share amounts\\npresented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.\\nRevenue\\nRevenue was a record $30.0 billion, up 122% from a year ago and up 15% sequentially.\\nData Center revenue was a record, up 154% from a year ago and up 16% sequentially. The strong\\nsequential and year-on-year growth was driven by demand for our Hopper GPU computing platform\\nfor training and inferencing of large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI\\napplications. Sequential growth was driven by consumer internet and enterprise companies. Cloud\\nservice providers represented roughly 45% of our Data Center revenue, and more than 50% stemmed\\nfrom consumer internet and enterprise companies. Strong year-on-year growth was driven by all\\ncustomer types from both compute and networking revenue. Customers continue to accelerate their\\nHopper architecture purchases while gearing up to adopt Blackwell. Data Center compute revenue\\nwas $22.6 billion, up 162% from a year ago and up 17% sequentially. Networking revenue was $3.7\\nbillion, up 114% from a year ago driven by InfiniBand and Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes\\nSpectrum-X end-to-end ethernet platform. Networking revenue sequentially was up 16% and\\nincludes a doubling of Ethernet for AI revenue.\\nWe shipped customer samples of our Blackwell architecture in the second quarter. We executed a\\nchange to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield. Blackwell production ramp is\\nscheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026. In the fourth quarter, we\\nexpect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue. Hopper demand is strong, and shipments\\nare expected to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025.\\nGaming revenue was up 16% from a year ago and up 9% sequentially. These increases reflect higher\\nsales of our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs and game console SOCs. We had solid demand in the\\nsecond quarter for our gaming GPUs as part of the back-to-school season.\\nProfessional Visualization revenue was up 20% from a year ago and up 6% sequentially. These\\nincreases were driven by the continued ramp of RTX GPU workstations based on our Ada\\narchitecture.\\nAutomotive revenue was up 37% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. These increases were\\ndriven by AI Cockpit solutions and self-driving platforms.\\nGross Margin\\nGAAP and non-GAAP gross margins increased from a year ago on strong Data Center revenue growth\\nprimarily driven by our Hopper GPU computing platform. Sequentially, gross margins decreased\\nprimarily driven by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material and a higher mix of new\\nproducts within Data Center.\\nExpenses\\nGAAP operating expenses were up 48% from a year ago and up 12% sequentially, and non-GAAP\\noperating expenses were up 52% from a year ago and up 12% sequentially. These increases were\\nlargely driven by compensation and benefits, reflecting growth in employees and compensation.',\n",

BUSINESS\\nOverview\\nWe design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer\\nservices related to our products. We generally sell our products directly to customers, and continue to grow our customer-facing infrastructure through a\\nglobal network of vehicle showrooms and service centers, Mobile Service, body shops, Supercharger stations and Destination Chargers to accelerate the\\nwidespread adoption of our products. We emphasize performance, attractive styling and the safety of our users and workforce in the design and\\nmanufacture of our products and are continuing to develop full self-driving technology for improved safety. We also strive to lower the cost of ownership\\nfor our customers through continuous efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and by offering financial and other services tailored to our products.\\nOur mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We believe that this mission, along with our engineering expertise,\\nvertically integrated business model and focus on user experience differentiate us from other companies.\\nSegment Information\\nWe operate as two reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\\nThe automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of high-performance fully electric vehicles as well as\\nsales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment also includes services and other, which includes sales of used vehicles, non-\\nwarranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts, paid Supercharging, vehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise. The energy generation\\nand storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related\\nservices and sales of solar energy systems incentives.\\nOur Products and Services\\nAutomotive\\nWe currently manufacture five different consumer vehicles – the Model 3, Y, S, X and Cybertruck. Model 3 is a four-door mid-size sedan that we\\ndesigned for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal. Model Y is a compact sport utility vehicle (“SUV”) built on the Model 3 platform\\nwith seating for up to seven adults. Model S is a four-door full-size sedan and Model X is a mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven adults. Model S and\\nModel X feature the highest performance characteristics and longest ranges that we offer in a sedan and SUV, respectively. In November 2023, we\\nentered the consumer pickup truck market with first deliveries of the Cybertruck, a full-size electric pickup truck with a stainless steel exterior that has\\nthe utility and strength of a truck while featuring the speed of a sports car.\\nIn 2022, we also began early production and deliveries of a commercial electric vehicle, the Tesla Semi. We have planned electric vehicles to\\naddress additional vehicle markets, and to continue leveraging developments in our proprietary Full Self-Driving (“FSD”) Capability features, battery cell\\nand other technologies.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nEnergy Storage Products\\nPowerwall and Megapack are our lithium-ion battery energy storage products. Powerwall, which we sell directly to customers, as well as through\\nchannel partners, is designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility. Megapack is an energy storage solution for commercial, industrial,\\nutility and energy generation customers, multiple of which may be grouped together to form larger installations of gigawatt hours (“GWh”) or greater\\ncapacity.\\nWe also continue to develop software capabilities for remotely controlling and dispatching our energy storage systems across a wide range of\\nmarkets and applications, including through our real-time energy control and optimization platforms.\\n4',\n",

We purchase most of the components for our retrofit solar energy systems from multiple sources to ensure competitive pricing and\\nadequate supply. We also design and manufacture certain components for our solar energy products.\\nWe sell our Solar Roof, which combines premium glass roof tiles with energy generation, directly to customers, as well as through channel\\ncustomers. We continue to improve our installation capability and efficiency, including through collaboration with real estate developers and builders on\\nnew homes.\\nTechnology\\nAutomotive\\nBattery and Powertrain\\nOur core vehicle technology competencies include powertrain engineering and manufacturing and our ability to design vehicles that utilize the\\nunique advantages of an electric powertrain. We have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be adaptable, efficient, reliable and cost-effective\\nwhile withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment. We offer dual motor powertrain vehicles, which use two electric motors to maximize traction\\nand performance in an all-wheel drive configuration, as well as vehicle powertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further increased\\nperformance in certain versions of Model S and Model X, Cybertruck and the Tesla Semi.\\nWe maintain extensive testing and R&D capabilities for battery cells, packs and systems, and have built an expansive body of knowledge on lithium-\\nion cell chemistry types and performance characteristics. In order to enable a greater supply of cells for our products with higher energy density at lower\\ncosts, we have developed a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improved manufacturing processes.\\nVehicle Control and Infotainment Software\\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs utilize sophisticated control software. Control systems in our vehicles\\noptimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging and control all infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software,\\nincluding most of the user interfaces, internally and update our vehicles’ software regularly through over-the-air updates.\\nSelf-Driving Development and Artificial Intelligence\\nWe have expertise in developing technologies, systems and software to enable self-driving vehicles using primarily vision-based technologies. Our\\nFSD Computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles, and we are also developing additional computer hardware to better enable the massive amounts\\nof field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural networks for real-world performance.\\nCurrently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD Capability options. Although at present the\\ndriver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle, our systems provide safety and convenience functionality that relieves drivers of the most\\ntedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel much like the system that airplane pilots use, when conditions permit. As with other vehicle\\nsystems, we improve these functions in our vehicles over time through over-the-air updates.\\nWe intend to establish in the future an autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network, which we expect would also allow us to access a new customer base\\neven as modes of transportation evolve.\\nWe are also applying our artificial intelligence learnings from self-driving technology to the field of robotics, such as through Optimus, a robotic\\nhumanoid in development, which is controlled by the same AI system.\\n5',\n",

By taking a modular approach to the\\ndesign of battery systems, we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products. Additionally, our expertise in power electronics\\nenables our battery systems to interconnect with electricity grids while providing fast-acting systems for power injection and absorption. We have also\\ndeveloped software to remotely control and dispatch our energy storage systems.\\nSolar Energy Systems\\nWe have engineered Solar Roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation. The efficiency of our\\nsolar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which incorporates our power electronics technologies. We designed both products to integrate\\nwith Powerwall.\\nDesign and Engineering\\nAutomotive\\nWe have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems. Our\\nteam has significant experience in computer-aided design as well as durability, strength and crash test simulations, which reduces the product\\ndevelopment time of new models. We have also achieved complex engineering feats in stamping, casting and thermal systems, and developed a method\\nto integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without separate battery packs to optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost\\ncharacteristics.\\nWe are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while taking action to localize our vehicle designs and production for particular\\nmarkets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As we increase our capabilities, particularly in the\\nareas of automation, die-making and line-building, we are also making strides in the simulations modeling these capabilities prior to construction.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nOur expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design, engineer, manufacture and install energy generating and\\nstorage products and components, including at the residential through utility scale. For example, the modular design of our Megapack utility-scale battery\\nline is intended to significantly reduce the amount of assembly required in the field. We also customize solutions including our energy storage products,\\nsolar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet their specific needs.\\nSales and Marketing\\nHistorically, we have been able to achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. We continue to monitor our\\npublic narrative and brand, and tailor our marketing efforts accordingly, including through investments in customer education and advertising as\\nnecessary.\\nAutomotive\\nDirect Sales\\nOur vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some jurisdictions, we also have\\ngalleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not transact in the sale of vehicles. We believe this infrastructure\\nenables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, educate consumers about electric vehicles, make our vehicles more\\naffordable, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback.\\nWe reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our sales channels. However, sales\\nof vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to volatility from time to time.\\n6',\n",

The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third\\nparties. We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources including lease returns.\\nPublic Charging\\nWe have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial-grade, high-speed vehicle chargers. Where possible, we co-\\nlocate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power. Supercharger stations are typically\\nplaced along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle owners the ability to enjoy quick, reliable charging along an\\nextensive network with convenient stops. Use of the Supercharger network either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs. In\\nNovember 2021, we began to offer Supercharger access to non-Tesla vehicles in certain locations in support of our mission to accelerate the world’s\\ntransition to sustainable energy, and in November 2022, we opened up our previously proprietary charging connector as the North American Charging\\nStandard (NACS). This enables all electric vehicles and charging stations to interoperate — which makes charging easier and more efficient for everyone\\nand advances our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. Following this, a number of major automotive companies announced\\ntheir adoption of NACS, with their access to the Supercharger network beginning in phases in 2024 and their production of NACS vehicles beginning no\\nlater than 2025. We also engaged SAE International to govern NACS as an industry standard, now named J3400. We continue to monitor and increase our\\nnetwork of Tesla Superchargers in anticipation of future demand.\\nWe also work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting employees, to offer additional\\ncharging options for our customers, as well as single-family homeowners and multi-family residential entities, to deploy home charging solutions.\\nIn-App Upgrades\\nAs our vehicles are capable of being updated remotely over-the-air, our customers may purchase additional paid options and features through the\\nTesla app or through the in-vehicle user interface. We expect that this functionality will also allow us to offer certain options and features on a\\nsubscription basis in the future.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nWe market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential, commercial and industrial customers and utilities through a variety of\\nchannels, including through our website, stores and galleries, as well as through our network of channel partners, and in the case of some commercial\\ncustomers, through PPA transactions. We emphasize simplicity, standardization and accessibility to make it easy and cost-effective for customers to adopt\\nclean energy, while reducing our customer acquisition costs.\\nService and Warranty\\nAutomotive\\nService\\nWe provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service locations and through Tesla Mobile Service technicians who perform work\\nremotely at customers’ homes or other locations.

Our insurance products are currently available in 12 states and we plan to expand the markets in which we offer\\ninsurance products, as part of our ongoing effort to decrease the total cost of ownership for our customers.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nWe offer certain financing options to our solar customers, which enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system, Solar Roof or\\nintegrated solar and Powerwall system. Our solar PPAs, offered primarily to commercial customers, charge a fee per kilowatt-hour based on the amount of\\nelectricity produced by our solar energy systems.\\nManufacturing\\nWe currently have manufacturing facilities in the U.S. in Northern California, in Buffalo, New York, Gigafactory New York; in Austin, Texas,\\nGigafactory Texas and near Reno, Nevada, Gigafactory Nevada. At these facilities, we manufacture and assemble, among other things, vehicles, certain\\nvehicle parts and components, such as our battery packs and battery cells, energy storage components and solar products and components.\\nInternationally, we also have manufacturing facilities in China (Gigafactory Shanghai) and Germany (Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg), which allows\\nus to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating the\\nimpact of unfavorable tariffs. In March 2023, we announced the location of our next Gigafactory in Monterrey, Mexico. Generally, we continue to expand\\nproduction capacity at our existing facilities. We also intend to further increase cost-competitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding\\nlocal manufacturing.\\nSupply Chain\\nOur products use thousands of parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world. We have developed close relationships with\\nvendors of key parts such as battery cells, electronics and complex vehicle assemblies. Certain components purchased from these suppliers are shared or\\nare similar across many product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale.\\n8',\n",

The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and\\nenergy storage manufacture or purchase, including through providing tax credits to consumers. For example, qualifying Tesla customers may receive up\\nto $7,500 in federal tax credits for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles in the U.S. through 2032.\\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles (“ZEVs”), greenhouse gas, fuel\\neconomy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory\\nrequirements. Sales of these credits are recognized within automotive regulatory credits revenue in our consolidated statements of operations included\\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nEnergy Storage System Incentives and Policies\\nWhile the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms\\nat the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage.\\nFor example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S. federal tax credits\\ndescribed below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale\\nenergy markets. In addition, California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage, and behind-the-meter energy\\nstorage systems qualify for funding under the California Self Generation Incentive Program. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these\\nprograms. In certain instances our customers may transfer such credits to us as contract consideration.

Our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable\\nFMVSS with limited or no exemptions, however, FMVSS are subject to change from time to time. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles\\nmeet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S.\\nWe are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, Theft\\nPrevention Act requirements, labeling requirements and other information provided to customers in writing, Early Warning Reporting requirements\\nregarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, a Standing General Order requiring reports regarding crashes\\ninvolving vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems, and additional requirements for cooperating with compliance and safety\\ninvestigations and recall reporting. The U.S. Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain\\ninformation regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel\\neconomy ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and New Car\\nAssessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available.\\nOur vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those\\nregulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Some of those regulations impact or prevent the\\nrollout of new vehicle features.\\nSelf-Driving Vehicles\\nGenerally, laws pertaining to self-driving vehicles are evolving globally, and in some cases may create restrictions on features or vehicle designs\\nthat we develop. While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations pertaining specifically to self-driving vehicles or self-driving equipment, NHTSA has\\npublished recommended guidelines on self-driving vehicles, apart from the FMVSS and manufacturer reporting obligations, and retains the authority to\\ninvestigate and/or take action on the safety or compliance of any vehicle, equipment or features operating on public roads.

Certain states have asserted that the laws in such states do not permit automobile\\nmanufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or that they otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or perform\\nwarranty repairs on vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the sale out of the state.\\nIn certain such states, we have opened “galleries” that serve an educational purpose and where sales may not occur.\\nSome automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative\\nprocesses to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations. Certain dealer associations have also actively\\nlobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to our ownership and operation of our\\nown retail and service locations. We expect such challenges to continue, and we intend to actively fight any such efforts.\\nBattery Safety and Testing\\nOur battery packs are subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined to include lithium-\\nion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation.

To operate our\\nsystems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities. Sales of electricity and non-sale equipment leases by third parties,\\nsuch as our leases and PPAs, have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions.\\nSolar Energy—Net Metering\\nMost states in the U.S. make net energy metering, or net metering, available to solar customers. Net metering typically allows solar customers to\\ninterconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated\\nby their solar energy system that is exported to the grid.

Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all\\nother continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to exceed $10.00 billion in 2024 and be\\nbetween $8.00 to $10.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years.\\nOur business has been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital\\nmanagement resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also generally facilitating positive cash\\ngeneration. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and\\nprovide financing options to our customers. At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods\\ndepending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain',\n",

We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers.\\nPayments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for\\nwhich payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration\\nfor expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our\\ninternet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized\\nover time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging\\nincentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services\\nover the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD Capability features is recognized when\\nfunctionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we\\nestimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information\\nthat may be available.\\nInventory Valuation\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which\\napproximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about\\ncurrent and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory.\\nThis requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product.\\nOnce inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result\\nin the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.',\n",

These estimates are based on actual claims\\nincurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our\\nhistorical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future.

These inputs are\\nsubjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our\\ncommon stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards,\\nusually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is\\nrecognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual\\nperformance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may\\ncalculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based\\ncompensation expense that we will recognize in future periods.

(“Tesla”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop,\\nmanufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our\\nproducts. Our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), organizes our company, manages resource allocations and\\nmeasures performance among two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and reflect our accounts and operations and\\nthose of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”), we\\nconsolidate any variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We have formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary\\ncourse of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our\\ndirect vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity;\\nhowever, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC\\n810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the\\nVIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits\\nfrom the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not\\nconsidered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 16, Variable Interest Entity\\nArrangements). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All\\nintercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. The estimates used for, but not limited to,\\ndetermining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, income taxes, the collectability of accounts\\nand finance receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual\\nvalue of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any\\nspecific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or\\nliabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is\\nobtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\\nReclassifications\\nCertain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the\\naccompanying notes.\\n54',\n",

We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer,\\nwhich is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms\\ncustomary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return\\nreserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback\\nterms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are\\nprovisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such\\nservices to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We\\nrecognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle.\\nRevenue related to FSD Capability features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized\\nover time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the\\nservice, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\\nAny fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales\\nrevenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to\\nautomotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to\\nshipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over\\nvehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes\\ncollected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\\n55',\n",

We estimate a guarantee liability in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees and record it within other liabilities on our consolidated\\nbalance sheet. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market value of vehicles sold under this program to determine whether there have been\\nchanges to the amount of expected resale value guarantee payments.

Qualifying\\ncustomers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers are generally required to\\nreturn the vehicles to us. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a\\nstraight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $1.86 billion, $1.75 billion and $1.25 billion of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of\\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, we had deferred $458 million and $407 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized\\non a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.\\nOur policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\\nDirect Sales-Type Leasing Program\\nWe have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842, Leases\\n(“ASC 842”), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Depending on the specific program, customers may or may not have a right to return the vehicle to\\nus during or at the end of the lease term. If the customer does not have a right to return, the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease\\nterm after making all contractual payments. Under the programs for which there is a right to return, the purchase option is reasonably certain to be\\nexercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual\\npayments. Our arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-\\ntype lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest\\nincome based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the\\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $215 million, $683 million and $369 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue\\nand $164 million, $427 million and $234 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue.\\nServices and Other Revenue\\nServices and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts, paid Supercharging,\\nvehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise.\\nRevenues related to repair, maintenance and vehicle insurance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service\\nplans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell\\nused vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue\\nallocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, vehicle\\ncomponents, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary\\nto the business.

Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of\\nthe engineering, design and installation of the system. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy\\nsystem upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system\\nand the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale\\ncommercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the\\nproduct has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon\\ninvoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.\\nFor large commercial and utility grade energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system,\\ncustomers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time\\nusing the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales.\\nIn instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the\\ncontract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using\\nmarket data for comparable products. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of energy\\nstorage systems. As our contract costs related to energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are\\nexpensed as incurred.\\nAs part of our energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system\\nwill meet or exceed the minimum energy performance requirements specified in the contract. If an energy storage system does not meet the\\nperformance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large\\ncommercial and utility grade energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market\\nparticipation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract\\ninception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates\\nare included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments, which is\\nrecognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenue related to such\\ncustomer payments amounted to $1.60 billion and $863 million, respectively, mainly due to contractual payment terms. Revenue recognized from the\\ndeferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $571 million and $171 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\\nrespectively.

In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider\\nour history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual\\nearnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary\\ndifferences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company’s projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating\\nresults relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions\\nimpacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income.\\nOur valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.\\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is\\nmore likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities.

We have determined\\nthat the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the methodology for\\ncalculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit-sharing arrangements is a\\nbalance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling\\ninterests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on\\nthe consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV\\nmethod, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the\\namounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets\\nof the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and\\ndistributed to the third parties.

However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least\\nequal to the redemption amount.

Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible debt instruments, the\\nmost significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share\\nsettlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies\\nfor a scope exception from derivative accounting.

In addition to these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February 11, 2019 in the U.S.\\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then\\nconstituted. Those cases have also been consolidated and stayed pending resolution of the appeal in the above-referenced consolidated purported\\nstockholder class action.\\nOn October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging, among other things, that\\nboard members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the Company’s 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among\\nother things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company’s corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys’ fees. The\\nparties reached an agreement to stay the case until March 5, 2024.\\nOn November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank (“JP Morgan”) filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the Southern District of New York alleging breach of a\\nstock warrant agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014. In 2018, JP Morgan informed Tesla that it had adjusted the\\nstrike price based upon Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. Tesla disputed JP Morgan’s adjustment as a\\nviolation of the parties’ agreement. In 2021, Tesla delivered shares to JP Morgan per the agreement, which they duly accepted. JP Morgan now alleges\\nthat it is owed approximately $162 million as the value of additional shares that it claims should have been delivered as a result of the adjustment to the\\nstrike price in 2018. On January 24, 2022, Tesla filed multiple counterclaims as part of its answer to the underlying lawsuit, asserting among other points\\nthat JP Morgan should have terminated the stock warrant agreement in 2018 rather than make an adjustment to the strike price that it should have\\nknown would lead to a commercially unreasonable result. Tesla believes that the adjustments made by JP Morgan were neither proper nor commercially\\nreasonable, as required under the stock warrant agreements. JP Morgan filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which Tesla opposed, and that\\nmotion is currently pending before the Court.\\nLitigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment\\nOn October 4, 2021, in a case captioned Diaz v. Tesla, a jury in the Northern District of California returned a verdict against Tesla on claims by a\\nformer contingent worker that he was subjected to race discrimination while assigned to work at Tesla’s Fremont Factory from 2015-2016. A retrial was\\nheld starting on March 27, 2023, after which a jury returned a verdict of $3,175,000. As a result, the damages awarded against Tesla were reduced from\\nan initial $136.9 million (October 4, 2021) down to $15 million (April 13, 2022), and then further down to $3.175 million (April 3, 2023).

As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should\\nbe determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which\\nprioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level\\nII) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is\\nlittle or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value. Our assets and\\nliabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions):\\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\\nFair Value Level I Level II Level III Fair Value Level I Level II Level III\\nCertificates of deposit and time\\ndeposits $ 8,488 $ — $ 8,488 $ — $ 6,996 $ — $ 6,996 $ —\\nCommercial paper 4,311 — 4,311 — 470 — 470 —\\nU.S. government securities 3,312 — 3,312 — 5,136 — 5,136 —\\nCorporate debt securities 372 — 372 — 480 — 480 —\\nMoney market funds 10 10 — — 109 109 — —\\nTotal $ 16,493 $ 10 $ 16,483 $ — $ 13,191 $ 109 $ 13,082 $ —\\nAll of our money market funds were classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in active\\nmarkets. Our U.S. government securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, time deposits and corporate debt securities are classified within Level\\nII of the fair value hierarchy and the market approach was used to determine fair value of these investments.\\n15',\n",

In 2018, JP Morgan informed Tesla that it had adjusted the\\nstrike price based upon Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. Tesla disputed JP Morgan’s adjustment as a\\nviolation of the parties’ agreement. In 2021, Tesla delivered shares to JP Morgan per the agreement, which they duly accepted. JP Morgan now alleges\\nthat it is owed approximately $162 million as the value of additional shares that it claims should have been delivered as a result of the adjustment to the\\nstrike price in 2018. On January 24, 2022, Tesla filed multiple counterclaims as part of its answer to the underlying lawsuit, asserting among other points\\nthat JP Morgan should have terminated the stock warrant agreement in 2018 rather than make an adjustment to the strike price that it should have\\nknown would lead to a commercially unreasonable result. Tesla believes that the adjustments made by JP Morgan were neither proper nor commercially\\nreasonable, as required under the stock warrant agreements. JP Morgan filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which Tesla opposed, and that\\nmotion is currently pending before the Court.\\nCertain Derivative Lawsuits in Delaware\\nBefore converting from a Delaware to Texas corporation on June 13, 2024, three separate derivative actions brought by purported Tesla\\nstockholders were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery on May 24, June 10 and June 13, 2024, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against current and\\nformer directors regarding topics involving Elon Musk and others, X Corp. (formerly Twitter) and x.AI. These suits assert various claims, including breach\\nof fiduciary duty and breach of contract, and seek unspecified damages and other relief.\\nLitigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment\\nOn February 9, 2022, the California Civil Rights Department (“CRD,” formerly “DFEH”) filed a civil complaint against Tesla in Alameda County,\\nCalifornia Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims, among others. CRD’s amended\\ncomplaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. On September 22, 2022, Tesla filed a cross complaint against CRD, alleging that it violated the\\nAdministrative Procedures Act by failing to follow statutory pre-requisites prior to filing suit and that cross complaint was subject to a sustained demurrer,\\nwhich Tesla later amended and refiled. The case is currently in discovery. Trial is scheduled for September 15, 2025.\\nAdditionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the\\nCRD’s allegations. On September 28, 2023, the EEOC filed a civil complaint against Tesla in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\\nCalifornia asserting claims for race harassment and retaliation and seeking, among other things, monetary and injunctive relief.\\nOn June 16, 2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, purportedly on\\nbehalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current and former directors.

We are focused on ramping the production and increasing\\nthe market penetration of our energy storage products.\\nDuring the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized total revenues of $25.50 billion and $46.80 billion, respectively, representing\\nan increase of $573 million and a decrease of $1.46 billion, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. During the three and six months\\nended June 30, 2024, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $1.48 billion and $2.61 billion, respectively, representing decreases of\\n$1.23 billion and $2.61 billion, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. We continue to ramp production and build and optimize our\\nmanufacturing capacity, expand our operations while focusing on further cost reductions and operational efficiencies to enable increased deliveries and\\ndeployments of our products, and invest in research and development to accelerate our AI, software, and fleet-based profits for further revenue growth.\\nWe ended the second quarter of 2024 with $30.72 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $1.63 billion\\nfrom the end of 2023. Our cash flows provided by operating activities were $3.85 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $5.58\\nbillion during the same period ended June 30, 2023, representing a decrease of $1.72 billion. Capital expenditures amounted to $5.04 billion during the\\nsix months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $4.13 billion during the same period ended June 30, 2023, representing an increase of $911 million.

The next phase of production growth will depend on the\\ncontinued ramp at our factories and be initiated by advances in autonomy and the introduction of new products, including those built on our next\\ngeneration vehicle platform, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are\\ndeveloping to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease\\nproduction costs and increase affordability and customer awareness.\\nThese plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new product\\nand manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages\\nand any future impact from events outside of our control. For example, during the first quarter of 2024, we experienced a sequential decline in production\\nvolumes partially caused by the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory, and factory shutdowns at Gigafactory\\nBerlin-Brandenburg resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological\\ntargets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory.\\nAutomotive—Demand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure\\nOur cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability\\nand have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand by improving our vehicles’ performance and\\nfunctionality, including through product offerings and features based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot, FSD (Supervised), and other software, and\\ndelivering new vehicles and vehicle options. In addition, we have been increasing awareness, and expanding our vehicle financing programs, including\\nattractive leasing terms for our customers. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and\\nincreasing environmental regulations and initiatives.\\nHowever, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the\\nenvironment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, interest rate fluctuations and the liquidity of enterprise\\ncustomers. For example, inflationary pressures have increased across the markets in which we operate. In an effort to curb this trend, central banks in\\ndeveloped countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, impacting the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of\\nvehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our\\noperations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to\\nadjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum.

In general,\\nwe are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our operating\\nresults as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk.\\nWe have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-\\nmeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and\\ncash and cash equivalents balances).\\nWe considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign\\ncurrency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and\\nliabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on\\nour net income before income taxes.

In designing and\\nevaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and\\noperated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures\\nmust reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible\\ncontrols and procedures relative to their costs.\\nBased on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and\\nprocedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to\\ndisclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the\\nSEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our\\nChief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which has materially\\naffected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\n35',\n",

Here are a few key points:\n\n1. Revenue: The company expects revenue of $32.5 billion in Q3 FY2025, with a plus or minus 2% margin.\n2. Gross margins: Both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be around 74.4% and 75.0%, respectively, with a ±50 basis points margin.\n3. Operating expenses: GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.3 billion, while non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be around $3.0 billion.\n\nFrom these numbers, it seems that NVIDIA's revenue and gross margins are expected to remain strong in the near future. However, operating expenses are expected to increase by a significant margin (mid-to-upper 40% range).\n\nAs for whether people should consider buying Nvidia stock based on this report alone, it ultimately depends on individual investment goals and risk tolerance. Here are some points to consider:\n\n* If you're looking for short-term gains, the relatively stable revenue and gross margins might be attractive.\n* However, if you're concerned about the company's increasing operating expenses, which could impact profitability in the long run, you might want to wait or reconsider your investment.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just a snapshot of one financial report, and there are many other factors that can influence a stock's performance. It's always important to do thorough research and consult with financial experts before making any investment decisions.",
